# ðŸ“¼ VCR (`http`)

A package to store and replay requests using the `http` package.

## Getting Started

Create a client:

```dart
VcrClient client = VcrClient(cassettePath: 'cassette_path');
Response response = await client.get('https://api.github.com/users/keviinlouis/repos');
```

To use a different cassette create another `VcrClient` instance.

## Replaying the recorded requests

Create a new `VcrClient` instance with the same `cassette_path`. If the cassette file already ex

### Using with custom Client
